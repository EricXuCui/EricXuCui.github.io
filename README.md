Developed a basic AI behavior Tree that can implemented the mainstream video games by using **C++** and **Unreal Engine 4**. This project is inspired from **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice**, and **Dark Souls Series**, etc. it includes a lot of AI mechanisms, such as Attacking, Doding, strafe walk and using utimate skills etc.


### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
