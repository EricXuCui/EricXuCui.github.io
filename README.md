This lecture is about developing a basic AI behavior tree template that can be used to implement mainstream video games using **C++** and **Unreal Engine 4**. Inspired by **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** and the **Dark Souls Series**, this project incorporates various modern AI mechanisms such as attacking, dodging, strafe walking, and using multiple different ultimate skills against the player. It coordinates multiple AI features from Unreal Engine such as Blackboard, Decorators, Services, and Tasks. Additionally, there are separate English and Chinese versions of this lecture available (you may click the portal below to learn more). I am proud that hundreds of students worldwide have enrolled in my courses, pursuing their dreams of becoming video game programmers.

### The Gyroscope-Powered Melee Project
In a world progressively driven by technology, gaming has become a cornerstone of entertainment. However, many traditional gaming platforms tend to be static in nature, lacking immersion and accessibility for a diverse range of players. Inspired by a desire to revolutionize the gaming industry. We developed a project by using **C++** on the **Unreal Engine 4 (UE4)** platform with **gyroscope technology (Motion Sensors, n.d.)** at its core, the game's character movements are controlled. Through simple tilt or movement, players can execute slashes, stabs, blocks with shields, and more, with each action depleting energy reserves. This year, we participated in the BC Youth Innovation Showcase, and our project has advanced to the [semifinals](https://www.sciencefairs.ca/news/2023/semifinalists-for-the-fifth-annual-youth-innovatio/)!
